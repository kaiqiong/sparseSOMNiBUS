# sparseSOMNiBUS

**Sparse Smooth Omnibus Model for Regional DNA Methylation QTL Mapping**

`sparseSOMNiBUS` is an R package for identifying **regional methylation QTLs (mQTLs)** using high-resolution bisulfite sequencing data.  
It implements the statistical method proposed in Zhao *et al.* (*Biostatistics*, 2025), which models associations between local SNPs and CpG methylation levels within genomic regions through sparsity-controlled, smoothly varying coefficient functions.

## üîç Overview

The figure below illustrates the `sparseSOMNiBUS` analysis pipeline, showing:
1. Mean methylation patterns by genotype at top SNPs,  
2. Smooth estimated SNP effects across CpG positions,  
3. Summary of SNP‚Äìregion associations across candidate variants.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **Joint regional modeling** of all CpGs and SNPs within a genomic region  
- **Sparse functional coefficients** estimated via penalized likelihood with a sparsity-smoothness pently
- **Variable selection and effect estimation** for SNP‚Äìregion associations (mQTL mapping)  
- **Biologically interpretable** smooth effects across CpG sites

## üìà Model fitting and tuning parameter selection

`sparseSOMNiBUS` fits a penalized regression model that balances **model smoothness** and **sparsity** through the tuning parameters *Œª* (penalty strength) and *Œ±* (mixing parameter).
The penalty encourages sparse, smoothly varying effects across CpG sites, allowing only a subset of SNPs to exhibit nonzero functional influence.

To select *Œª*, the package uses **K-fold cross-validation** and evaluates the **mean validation deviance** over a grid of candidate Œª values.
Two commonly used selection rules are implemented:

- **Œª_min** ‚Äî the value of Œª that minimizes the mean validation deviance;  
- **Œª_1SE** ‚Äî the largest Œª within one standard error of the minimum, providing a more parsimonious model.

Cross-validation selects the optimal Œª via the minimum mean deviance (Œª_min) and the 1-SE rule (Œª_1SE)*
